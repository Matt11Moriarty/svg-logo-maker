# svg-logo-maker

## Description

This application can be used to create simple logos for users who need to create a simple logo and deploy it in the browser!
SVG files can be complicated to create manually, so by generating them automatically based on user input, logo designers can save a lot of time.

In building this application, I was able to get very familiar with NPM packages like fs, inquirer, and path. I got more familiar with modularizating my code, and writing tests to verify everything is working as expected.
